# App Protect Policy Configuration by SNI routing
The Ingress Controller supports setting different WAF policies by hostnames.
**Note:** This feature is only available in NGINX Plus. Before moving forward, make sure you have the NGINX Plus Ingress Controller with App Protect already installed and running in your Kubernetes cluster.
